# ðŸŽ“ Student Dropout Risk Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was completed as part of the **IIT Madras â€“ Introduction to Data Science & AI** course.  
The objective was to predict the risk of student dropouts using machine learning classification and clustering techniques, and to identify key factors that contribute to student attrition.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Size:** 500 student records  
- **Attributes:** 15 features (GPA, attendance, engagement, etc.)  
- **Source:** Provided in course materials  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, feature scaling, and formatting fixes

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Techniques:** K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), K-Means Clustering, EDA

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics and data visualization  
   - Detection of patterns and anomalies  
   - Identification of high-risk indicators  

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification**  
   - Classified students based on dropout risk  
   - Achieved ~85% accuracy  

3. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Segmented students into 3 meaningful groups  
   - Visualized clusters with scatter plots

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- **GPA < 2.0**, **attendance < 60%**, and **low engagement** strongly correlated with dropout risk  
- Early intervention can help reduce dropout rates  
- Machine learning tools are effective in identifying high-risk students
